    <h1>Noah Dunleavy's Webpage</h1>
    <p>At first I wasn't sure how I wanted to structure this. Was it going to be third person, first? Then I realized that neither of those are really me. What is me is this right here. First off, I am not going to lie, this isn't an easy challenge for me. I have several years of expeirence in C, C++, and Java, as well as some experience with Python and SQL. And the time I have had to figure this out, well lets just say it hasn't been a ton. In two days I have a midterm in Math23, a quiz in Engs22, and Project due in Engs20, all after having an Econ01 quiz last wednesday.As you can see, I am taking on a lot. And this feels like the only place in which I can share that with good reason. So below is going to be my attempts to show not how nice I can make things look, although I will try, but also how much I can figure outon the fly about HTML</p>
    <h2>First off, I'm going to mess around with document structure</h2>
    <h3>I want to explore what happenes as I increase the number that follows the header indicator in the html script</h3>
    <h8>What happens if I try to make a large jump from 3 (above) to 8 (current)</h8>
    <p>It now ressembles normal text</p>
    <h3>Pulling an image from the web, and there is only one of me that I know of</h3>

    <p>I wanted to mess around with adding images, and as far as I know, there is only one public image of me on the web. So I wanted to take this oppurtunity to talk a little bit about myself.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Noah Dunleavy, and I am 19 years old. I have 3 older siblings, a dog, and live in Annapolis, Maryland. For the final 8 years of my pre-college education, I attended McDonogh School in Owings Mills, Maryland. Once in high school there, I joined the cross country and track and field team. My freshman year was unremarkable: In cross-country I ran a 24:55 5k and opened up my indoor track season with a 6-minute mile. My grades were alright, but I was not happy with the letter-to-work ratio.</p>
    <p>Starting my sophmore year, I started to pick it up, however. I took AP Computer Science A, I dropped my 5k time (over the course of the previous year of course) to a 17:40 and made the varsity team, and I was finally able to join the First Robotics Competition team. This trend continued through my Junior year; I was able to take courses I liked and participate in the activities I enjoyed. I made Captain of the XC+TF teams, was runner-up for All-MIAA at my leagues cross country championship, continued with robotics, and was due to be captain of that the following year.</p>
    <p>Then covid hit, and everything kind of went crazy for everyone. Classes became a bore, and most of my days were filled with playing Minecraft with friends. The world was shutting down and so was my brain. And then I got hurt from running too much and I lost, in case you haven't been able to tell, one of my favorite hobbies and escapes.</p>
    <p>The work didn't stop of course. I applied to colleges, got in to at least one, and studied for my APs. I went from a mile/5k runner to a 400 runner in track, and by the end of my senior year, I felt that I had made the most of it.</p>
    <p>When I got to Dartmouth, I had two goals: Excel in the classroom and make the track team. And as time went on, and I accomplished one but not the other (still not on the team), I began to realize that I was missing out on so much. And I still am. This past Saturday, it was one of the most gorgeous days I've seen while at Hannover, and I spent it all in side. From 10:30 Am to 11:30 pm I was in Maclean 201 working. I decided to take 4 courses this term to push, to challenge myself, and that is certainly happening</p>
    <p>There aren't many places in which I can, well there's no other word for it, brag. I tel my parents my grades, but that is it. Currently I have a 3.9 GPA. I took Math 11, Physics 15/16, Writing 5 and Seminar, and Chem 5 for Fall and Winter Terms. I recieved a citation in Chem 5 before even knowing what they were. I decided to kick it up a notch this term with four courses, and even with that I have a %101 in Engs 20, a %98 in Engs 22, a %96 in Math 23, and an %89 in Econ 1. I enjoy working harder, and proving to myself more than anyone else just how much I can do.</p>
    <p>Part of the reason is my Dad. He was a '91 from here and every day that I have know him, he has worked harder than everyone else around him. And I would say the same thing today that I said in 1st grade if I were to be asked who my role model was: him. He worked and paid his way through this college, so I wouldn't have to. His hard work enables me to take chances and oppurtunities that he could never afford to. He had to leave the track team his freshman year, and I can afford to keep trying. He had to become a UGA to help pay for room and board, I get to be one because I thought it would be a great oppurtunity for me to give back to the school. His hard work is what drives me to always be better.</p>

    <h3>End</h3>
    <p1>So there we go. A little bit about me, a little bit of learning https, git, making sure I had all the software installed, ect. Though I do realize, most of the process isn't entirely evident through this webpage. I decided to leave in some of my tester/learning lines, and I hope that doesn't too heavily distract from the challenge submission. Thank you for your time and consideration, have a great day!</p1>
